# Pachirisu-Script
This is a penetration testing tool for use with OSCP.

## Introduction
This is a tool to be used instead of Meterpreter at OffSec Certified Professional (OSCP). Meterpreter can only be used once during an exam. However, the reverse shell using nc.exe is difficult to use. So I decided to create a reverse shell and receiver with some of the functionality of Meterpreter for my own use.

I like Pachirisu from Pokemon so I named my tool after it.
